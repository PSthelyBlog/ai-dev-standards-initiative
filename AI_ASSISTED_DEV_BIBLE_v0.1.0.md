# The AI-Assisted Dev Bible: A Comprehensive Standardization Framework

**Authors:** Philippe Sthely
**Date:** [05/08/2025]
**Version:** 0.1.0

The rapid integration of AI tools into software development has revolutionized how we build software, but it's also created a chaotic landscape of varying practices, inconsistent methodologies, and unclear standards. This document establishes the first comprehensive standardization framework for AI-assisted development, providing structured guidelines for everyone from solo developers to enterprise teams.

## The current AI-assisted development landscape remains fragmented

AI has dramatically changed software development practices over the past five years. As of 2025, more than **76% of developers** use AI tools in their workflow, with code generation being the most common application (82% of users). While productivity benefits are substantial—with studies showing 20-50% faster coding times and 17-43% overall productivity improvements—the industry lacks standardized approaches to maximize these gains while mitigating risks.

Several organizations have begun establishing frameworks that influence AI-assisted development standards. The NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF), ISO/IEC 42001:2023, and the EU AI Act (effective August 2024) provide foundation elements for governance. However, significant gaps remain in implementation guidance, tool-specific standards, integration with existing methodologies, measurement frameworks, and cross-regional harmonization.

This document synthesizes current best practices into a comprehensive standardization framework while establishing new standards where gaps exist. It's designed to be practical, adaptable, and applicable across development contexts.

## 1. Standard prompt engineering patterns and templates

### Core prompt pattern categories

Effective AI-assisted development relies on structured prompt patterns that produce consistent, high-quality results:

1. **Persona patterns**: Instruct the AI to adopt specific expertise roles
   ```
   Act as a senior security engineer with OWASP expertise reviewing this authentication code
   ```

2. **Context manager patterns**: Provide structured context for the AI to reference
   ```
   Remember that this project uses TypeScript, follows the repository pattern, and requires Jest tests for all components
   ```

3. **Template patterns**: Provide explicit structures for AI outputs
   ```
   Generate a React component following this structure:
   - Imports
   - Interface definitions
   - Component function with JSX
   - Styled components
   - Export statement
   ```

4. **Reflection patterns**: Ask the AI to review and improve its output
   ```
   Review the code you just generated for potential security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and edge cases
   ```

5. **Question refinement patterns**: Instruct the AI to ask clarifying questions
   ```
   Before implementing this feature, ask me 3-5 clarifying questions about requirements that would help you create a better solution
   ```

6. **Chain of thought patterns**: Instruct the AI to reason step-by-step
   ```
   Think step-by-step through how to implement this algorithm, considering time complexity, space requirements, and edge cases
   ```

### Standardized prompt structure

All development prompts should include these standard components:

1. **Role/persona definition**: Establish expertise context
2. **Task specification**: Clearly define what needs to be accomplished
3. **Context information**: Provide relevant background information
4. **Format requirements**: Specify output structure
5. **Quality criteria**: Define standards for generated code
6. **Constraints**: Identify technical limitations

**Standard prompt template**:
```
Role: [Define the expertise role for the AI]
Task: [Specify what needs to be created or accomplished]
Context: [Provide relevant background information, existing codebase details]
