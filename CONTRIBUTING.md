# Contributing to the AI Development Standards Initiative

We welcome contributions to enhance and evolve these standards and frameworks! Whether it's fixing a typo, suggesting a clarification, proposing a new section, or offering a case study, your input is valuable.

## How to Contribute

*   **Reporting Issues:** If you find a bug, inconsistency, or have a question, please [open an issue](https://github.com/PSthelyBlog/ai-dev-standards-initiative/issues) on GitHub. Please provide as much context as possible.
*   **Suggesting Enhancements:** For major changes or new ideas, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. This allows for discussion before significant effort is invested.
*   **Pull Requests:**
    1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
    2. Create a new branch from `main` for your changes (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/your-brilliant-idea` or `git checkout -b fix/typo-in-section-2`).
    3. Make your changes, adhering to the style and principles of the existing documents.
    4. Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages. Consider the commit message standards outlined in "The AI-Assisted Dev Bible" for inspiration (e.g., `docs: Clarify prompt engineering patterns in Dev Bible Sec 1`).
    5. Push your branch to your fork (`git push origin feature/your-brilliant-idea`).
    6. Open a Pull Request from your fork's branch to the `main` branch of the `ai-dev-standards-initiative` repository.
    7. Clearly describe the changes you've made in the Pull Request description.
